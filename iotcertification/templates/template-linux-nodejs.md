# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Leez P515 device running Custom Linux with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   You should have Leez P515 (http://leez.lenovo.com)
-   Setup your IoT hub
-   Provision your device and get its credentials

# Step 3: Build and Run the Sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Then on deviceï¼š

        Get the latest version node.js (https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.3/node-v10.15.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz)
		Create node symbol link to /usr/bin/node
		Create npm symbol link to /usr/bin/npm
		cd ~
		git clone   https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node.git
		
		npm install -g azure-cli

## 3.2 Build the samples

-   Run following command to check

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples
        
    **For AMQP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-amqp
	
    **For HTTP Protocol:**
	
        npm install azure-iot-device-http
	
    **For MQTT Protocol:**

        npm install azure-iot-device-mqtt	

-   To update sample, run the following command on device.

        npm install es5-shim
		
		npm install lodash
		
		npm install azure-iot-device
		
		npm link azure-iot-device
		
		vi simple_sample_device.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the protocol information.
    
-   Find the below code:

        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
	
    The default protocol used is AMQP. Code for other protocols(HTTP/MQTT) are mentioned just below the above line in the script.
    Uncomment the line as per the protocol you want to use.


-   Scroll down to the connection information.
    Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from DeviceExplorer as explained in [Step 1], that you copied into Notepad.

-   export IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING=[IoT Device Connection String] ,Replace the above placeholder with device connection string.

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

-   Run the sample by issuing following command and verify that data has been successfully sent and received

        node ~/azure-iot-sdk-node/device/samples/simple_sample_device.js

-   See Manage IoT Hub to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

### 3.3.2 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See Manage IoT Hub to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
